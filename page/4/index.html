        <p>Getting through your work day on your own is easy enough.&nbsp; Over the long run, though,&nbsp; you’re going to need to have some solid relationships in your life to help get you through the rough patches and pick you up from the falls, but more importantly, to be there when it’s time to celebrate the wins.</p>
<p>While these are going to seem obvious at first, I want to make the point that they’re by no means effortless. In fact, some of the closest connections in your life can be the most affected by your choice to have your home serve also as your place of work.</p>
<h2 id="Your_Co-Workers"><a href="#Your_Co-Workers" class="headerlink" title="Your Co-Workers"></a>Your Co-Workers</h2><p><a href="https://jcblogimages.blob.core.windows.net/img/2015/07/office_relationships.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://jcblogimages.blob.core.windows.net/img/2015/07/office_relationships_thumb.jpg" alt="office_relationships" title="office_relationships"></a>In the movie <em>Office Space</em>, the main character Peter Gibbons pines that his motivation to work, or rather, to “work just hard enough not to get fired,” stems from unhealthy relationships with management. This <strong>cannot</strong> be your reality as a remote worker, and you need to make efforts to establish (and maintain) trust with your boss and teammates.</p>
<p>I have worked in blended environments where there was a head office with regular staff, but many remote workers and many office workers who had the option to work from home as they elected to do so. Being a permanent remote with very little office time (averaging about a day a month in the office) it was harder to get to know folks, but I knew it was really on me to own it.</p>
<p>Before you start at a company as a remote worker, or before you start working from home, talk to the management and other staff that already work remotely to see what it is like. If the atmosphere supports it, flying solo can be a great experience, but you still need the support of ground control. If you work as the only remote worker, or if management doesn’t trust or understand how productivity can work remotely, it may not be the right time for you to engage in flight.</p>
<h2 id="Fellow_Remote_Workers"><a href="#Fellow_Remote_Workers" class="headerlink" title="Fellow Remote Workers"></a>Fellow Remote Workers</h2><p>These ones are pretty important, especially in a company where there is a block of folks that work full-time at the office and a group that works remotely. Why are these folks good to know?</p>
<p>Because they <em>get ya</em>. They’re on the Skypes. They’re on the Slack. </p>
<p>They are trying to do the same things that you are doing and likely face the same challenges as you do. They look for solutions and have found tools that help them avoid the pitfalls. You’ve likely had to work through something that they haven’t yet, you have it figured out and it’s great to be able to share that with them. </p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to share your failures or ask for help! Being a good remote worker means mentoring and being mentored by other remote workers so that collectively we can all be really good at it. </p>
<h2 id="People_With_Absolutely_Nothing_to_do_with_Work"><a href="#People_With_Absolutely_Nothing_to_do_with_Work" class="headerlink" title="People With Absolutely Nothing to do with Work"></a>People With Absolutely Nothing to do with Work</h2><p>Ahhh…five o’clock, am I right? It’s that time when you disconnect from work and start to enjoy the more meaningful things in life. Of course, that means that you have be successful in leaving work in the first place, which can be tricky, but <a href="http://jameschambers.com/2015/03/working-from-home-and-walking-to-work-surviving-remote-work/">isn’t impossible to do</a>, especially if you’ve <a href="http://jameschambers.com/2015/03/wake-up-and-get-st-done-a-practice-of-awesome/">put in a good day</a>.</p>
<p>There a measure of counter-intuitiveness here that you’ll find. For example, keeping strong relationships in your own household is actually more about defining and maintaining boundaries during the workday than you might imagine. For example, if your office door is open as you’re working and your spouse, kids or roommates feel free to come and chat, you’re going to be less productive than you’d like to be. Over time, that loss of focus and reduced ability to create tangible outputs are going to start to turn into stress. Allowing the non-work relationships to bleed into your day can be a form of long term toxin that will erode your success as a remote worker.</p>
<p>Likewise, allowing your work day to bleed into your evenings and weekends will rob you of the best part of your day. Maybe you’re married with kids, fiancéed, or perhaps single, but the fact holds true regardless of your situation: marginalizing your family and friends to try to improve things at work will yield exactly zero positive results for your personal life. If you don’t agree with that statement, it’s simply because Dr. Seuss got the idea of the Grinch’s heart being two sizes too small from your life story. </p>
<p>There will be exceptions, where some rule-bending and time-bleeding will occur, but your job as a remote is to maintain that balance and be honest with yourself about how you’re doing in that regard.</p>
<h2 id="An_Old_Adage"><a href="#An_Old_Adage" class="headerlink" title="An Old Adage"></a>An Old Adage</h2><p>I do have to admit that I’m quite fortunate in this regard, as I’ve been able to align with an employer who is very much accustomed to and accepting of remote work. Working remotely, while becoming more common, isn’t yet universally accepted and I know from personal experience that if the culture isn’t there in the company, it can’t work on the long term.</p>
<p>It’s long and often been said that <strong>it takes a village to raise a child</strong>, and the reality of that statement is that at some point we have to grow up and be part of the village. As a remote worker, you need to remember that <strong>community isn’t going to just happen for you</strong>. Sure, you may not be raising kids, but the outcomes of your work efforts can only be best realized if you’re able to establish some great relationships along the way.</p>

        <p>We get set in our ways, don’t we? It’s funny how the sharper and more confident we get with our frameworks and the tooling we employ to work with them, we also get a little more attached to our way of doing things. And then along comes a major version change, ripe with breaking changes and new bits to twiddle and we’re left saying, “But, that’s not how we’ve always done it!”.</p>
<p>Case in point: <strong>service injection into views</strong>. In ASP.NET’s MVC Framework 6 we get this new concept which, if we’re going to accept, requires that we relax on our thinking of how we’ve always done things.</p>
<p>My friends <a href="https://twitter.com/dave_paquette" target="_blank" rel="external">Dave Paquette</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/stimms" target="_blank" rel="external">Simon Timms</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/canadianjames" target="_blank" rel="external">myself</a> have been ruffling through a few of these types of changes, and Simon did a great job of illustrating how we used to get data into our views, and how we might do it in <a href="http://blog.simontimms.com/2015/06/09/getting-lookup-data-into-you-view/" target="_blank" rel="external">tomorrow’s MVC</a>.  For a walkthrough of service injection I highly recommend his article on it.</p>
<p>How does it work? The new inject feature gives us the ability to asynchronously invoke methods on classes that are dynamically created and given to our view. It’s IoC for your UI.</p>
<p>Personally, I’d been wrestling with a good use case here because we had a way to do it, and it seems an obvious one (illustrated by Simon) had been missing my thought stream, likely because it’s been clouded for a few years with ViewBag. In all reality, the idea of using the ViewBag – a dynamic object that is double-blind, easily forgotten about and easily polluted – to push bits of data to the view has always kind of bugged me, no less than using filters did, but we didn’t have an elegant, framework-driven mechanism to make it happen more gracefully.  We do now.</p>
<p>Also, let’s not confuse things here: In more cases than not, your ViewModel is going to be the correct place to put your data, and where I’ve put my data for most things – like drop down lists – but this type of feature is exciting because it opens the door to explore new options in building views and experiences for our users.</p>
<h2 id="But_2C_doesn_u2019t_it_break_the_design_of_MVC_3F"><a href="#But_2C_doesn_u2019t_it_break_the_design_of_MVC_3F" class="headerlink" title="But, doesn’t it break the design of MVC?"></a>But, doesn’t it break the design of MVC?</h2><p>[caption id=”attachment_6491” align=”alignright” width=”300”]<a href="https://jcblogimages.blob.core.windows.net/img/2015/06/nuke.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://jcblogimages.blob.core.windows.net/img/2015/06/nuke-300x188.jpg" alt="Source: http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/photos/"></a> Sometimes things blow up when you try them out, but you still gotta try.[/caption]</p>
<p>Perhaps. Maybe, if you want to say, “The only definition valid for any framework is the original definition.” But we have more tools today to do our job, and in particular for this case dependency injection which has become a first-class citizen in ASP.NET. So, let’s rewind a bit and ask, why is it a bad practice to give a component the pieces it needs to do its work?</p>
<p>Let’s think of the type of problem that we’re trying to solve here, as Simon did in his article: a view needs to populate a dropdown list. It doesn’t need to access the database, and it shouldn’t have it. It doesn’t need to know a connection string, or if data is coming from a cache, a web service or otherwise, it just needs the data. Giving it an interface by which to look it up, well, to me that seems like a good idea.</p>
<p>If instead you favor the approach of using the controller to populate the ViewBag or use filters (or other techniques) you inherently introduce coupling to a specific view in the controller by forcing it to look up data to populate a dropdown box. <em>You are still injecting data into the view.</em> In my mind, the controller should know as little as possible about the view.  Why should I have to change my controller if I need to change my view?</p>
<p>I want to make a clear distinction here, though, as I do believe the controller answers very specific concerns, namely, those that deal with a particular entity. But the PersonController shouldn’t have to know the list of Canadian Provinces, should it?</p>
<h2 id="Don_u2019t_need_to_know_where_I_u2019m_going_2C_just_need_to_know_where_I_u2019ve_been"><a href="#Don_u2019t_need_to_know_where_I_u2019m_going_2C_just_need_to_know_where_I_u2019ve_been" class="headerlink" title="Don’t need to know where I’m going, just need to know where I’ve been"></a>Don’t need to know where I’m going, just need to know where I’ve been</h2><p>The assumption that the controller provides everything the view needs is guided by past pretence. It was true in MVC5 and earlier because it was what we had to work with. My point is that in MVC6 we now have a construct that allows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separation of concern/single responsibility</li>
<li>Testability</li>
<li>Type safety</li>
<li>Injectable dependencies<br>In my mind, the controller is just a component. So is the view. The controller’s concerns are related to the entity in question. The view is required to render correct UI such that a form can be filled out in a way that satisfies the requirements of the view model. Again, why use a person controller to retrieve details about countries and states?</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t see controllers as any more important than any other component. They have things they need, and they should have those things injected. My controllers don’t talk to the database, they talk to command objects and query objects via interface and those are injected from an IoC container.</p>
<p>I think now, with views as first-class components, that we can look at views in the same way.</p>
<h2 id="But_what_about_ViewBag_3F"><a href="#But_what_about_ViewBag_3F" class="headerlink" title="But what about ViewBag?"></a>But what about ViewBag?</h2><p>With ViewBag (and filters) we have a problem that we’re not really talking about in the best interest of not upsetting anyone. The fact that my controller has to do the lifting for the combo boxes is awkward and doesn’t really help us out too much with maintaining SRP. But we didn’t previously have a good way to address this.</p>
<p>We also tend to overlook the fact that Views are effectively code. Why can’t our principles apply to them as well? Of course I shouldn’t access the database from the view, but why can’t I know about an interface that does (and have it injected)?</p>
<p>This is a great use case of this new feature, and one that demonstrates that “not changing for the sake of not changing” isn’t a good mantra. If my view code/class/script is responsible for rendering the view, I see no problem injecting into it the things it needs to do so.</p>
<p>After all, isn’t that what you’re doing with ViewBag? Just injecting things into the view through the Dynamic? Except, with ViewBag, no one sees type problems and everyone has to cast. Now we’ve got run time errors.</p>
<p>There is the argument that says that even if we’re abstracting away the data access, we’re introducing the ability for the view to call the database. Again, I don’t think the view is any less important a component in the scheme of things, and there is a level of appropriateness with which we must use the feature. Will it be abused? Likely. You don’t want to be injecting database change-capable components into the view, but that is more a case of bad choices in implementation. You can completely destroy the maintainability of a project and wreak havoc on your users with service injection, but that doesn’t mean you should avoid it. I’ve seen people write 1,000 lines of code in a method, but that doesn’t mean I don’t use methods any more.</p>
<p><strong>When changes come to frameworks, I think it’s okay to rethink our best practices</strong>. Taking Simon’s approach we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interface-based injection</li>
<li>Abstraction from underlying data access strategy (db, cache, text file, whatever)</li>
<li>Testable components</li>
<li>Maintaining SRP in our controller and view</li>
<li>No casting from dynamic to proper types<br>I’m okay with this approach and will be using this approach in MVC 6 projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>I highly encourage you to do your own reading on this and explore the feature in greater detail. Here are a few links for your consideration.</p>

        <p>Things, they are a-changing!</p>
<p><a href="https://jcblogimages.blob.core.windows.net/img/2015/05/image.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://jcblogimages.blob.core.windows.net/img/2015/05/image_thumb.png" alt="image" title="image"></a>If you’ve played with different versions of ASP.NET 5 and MVC 6 along the way and have recently updated to the RC build of Visual Studio 2015 you’ll likely have noticed a few changes.&nbsp; Just a couple.</p>
<p>I found that I’ve been mostly able to survive the transition with a few questions around runtimes and where things have moved, but not all the bits are obvious. Here’s a list of some things that you’ll likely want to know as you navigate the M-V-Seas.&nbsp; (See what I did there? <img src="https://jcblogimages.blob.core.windows.net/img/2015/05/wlEmoticon-smilewithtongueout.png" alt="Smile with tongue out"> )</p>
<p>A big thanks goes out to fellow Canadian <a href="https://twitter.com/stimms" target="_blank" rel="external">Simon Timms</a> and beach bum <a href="https://twitter.com/Dave_Paquette" target="_blank" rel="external">Dave Paquette</a> for stumbling through these bits with and for me. #experts</p>
<h2 id="Renaming_and_Reorganization"><a href="#Renaming_and_Reorganization" class="headerlink" title="Renaming and Reorganization"></a>Renaming and Reorganization</h2><p>There used to be two separate commands for language services and running/booting up a site or application. These commands (k and klr) have both been merged with the runtime environment and are all now part of dnx, a.k.a. the .Net Execution environment.</p>
<p>The version manager, which was previously the kvm script (ps1 or sh, depending on environment), is now a command line utility called dnvm, or .Net Version Manager.</p>
<p>Finally, a new utility has been added that replaces the previous dependencies manager with a few enhancements (such as command hoisting from your project.json). The new name is dnu (the .Net Development Utility) and you use it to restore or manage packages, create NuGet packages or publish your project.</p>
<p>So, in summary:</p>
<p><pre class="csharpcode">k, klr, kre  =&gt; dnx<br>kvm          =&gt; dnvm<br>kpm          =&gt; dnu</pre></p>

<h2 id="So_You_Want_to_Run_a_Migration_3F"><a href="#So_You_Want_to_Run_a_Migration_3F" class="headerlink" title="So You Want to Run a Migration?"></a>So You Want to Run a Migration?</h2><p>We used to use the package manager console in Visual Studio to do our migrations work, however, this is not currently the case in VS2015. I imagine that this will continue to improve, but there is still a delta in the way that we used to do things. Today, we’re going to do things a little differently: in a properly prepared console, you’ll type the following in your <strong>project directory</strong> (not your solution directory):</p>
<p><pre class="csharpcode">dnx . ef [options] [command]</pre></p>
<style type="text/css">.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre
{
    font-size: small;
    color: black;
    font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;
    background-color: #ffffff;
    /*white-space: pre;*/
}
.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }
.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }
.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }
.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }
.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }
.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }
.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }
.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }
.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }
.csharpcode .alt 
{
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    width: 100%;
    margin: 0em;
}
.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }
</style>

<p>This command tells the .Net execution environment to use the current directory and to run the ef command. From there you could type migration or whatever else you’re looking for. Leaving the options and command out, for instance, gives you the magic unicorn of awesome.</p>
<h2 id="Wait_2C_That_Didn_u2019t_Work_3F"><a href="#Wait_2C_That_Didn_u2019t_Work_3F" class="headerlink" title="Wait, That Didn’t Work?"></a>Wait, That Didn’t Work?</h2><p>First of all, you’ll need to make sure that you have the tooling for the dn* utilities on your PATH. There needs to be environment variables setup to point you to the correct runtimes, or rather, the runtimes you’re currently targeting. You can see all the runtime versions you have installed by typing:</p>
<p><pre class="csharpcode">dnvm list</pre></p>
<style type="text/css">.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre
{
    font-size: small;
    color: black;
    font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;
    background-color: #ffffff;
    /*white-space: pre;*/
}
.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }
.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }
.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }
.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }
.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }
.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }
.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }
.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }
.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }
.csharpcode .alt 
{
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    width: 100%;
    margin: 0em;
}
.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }
</style>

<p>Typically, you’ll see two different <strong><em>runtimes</em></strong> (clr and coreclr) for each architecture (x64, x86), and you’ll see each of those for each <strong><em>version</em></strong> you have installed.</p>
<p>The “correct” version for your purposes may be a moving target, so make sure you have a runtime and version that works with the version of EF you have. If you’re not sure (or you thought you were sure but things aren’t working) take to <a href="https://jabbr.net/#/rooms/EntityFramework" target="_blank" rel="external">Jabbr</a> and ask for a hand (they are great there).</p>
<p>Next, your solution and/or project will have to have the correct references to EF. Edit your project.json to have the following dependencies and commands (you can do this in VS or Notepad or whatever tool you like, just save the file when you’re done):</p>
<p><pre class="csharpcode">  <span class="str">“dependencies”</span>: {<br>    <span class="str">“EntityFramework.SqlServer”</span>: <span class="str">“7.0.0-beta4”</span>,<br>    <span class="str">“EntityFramework.Commands”</span>: <span class="str">“7.0.0-beta4”</span>,<br>    …<br>  },</pre></p>
<p>  <span class="str">“commands”</span>: {<br>    <span class="str">“ef”</span>:  <span class="str">“EntityFramework.Commands”</span>,<br>    …<br>  },</p>
<style type="text/css">.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre
{
    font-size: small;
    color: black;
    font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;
    background-color: #ffffff;
    /*white-space: pre;*/
}
.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }
.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }
.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }
.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }
.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }
.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }
.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }
.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }
.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }
.csharpcode .alt 
{
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    width: 100%;
    margin: 0em;
}
.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }
</style>

<p>Almost there. Now we need to restore those packages locally so that you can use the EF tooling. To do that, we’re going to use the following command from the <strong>solution directory</strong>:</p>
<p><pre class="csharpcode">dnu restore</pre></p>
<style type="text/css">.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre
{
    font-size: small;
    color: black;
    font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;
    background-color: #ffffff;
    /*white-space: pre;*/
}
.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }
.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }
.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }
.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }
.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }
.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }
.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }
.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }
.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }
.csharpcode .alt 
{
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    width: 100%;
    margin: 0em;
}
.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }
</style>

<p>Voila! You should be good to go! Navigate to your <strong>project directory</strong> and hack away at your migrations. </p>
<h2 id="Keeping_Up_to_Date"><a href="#Keeping_Up_to_Date" class="headerlink" title="Keeping Up to Date"></a>Keeping Up to Date</h2><p>So, go grab Visual Studio 2015! If you run into trouble there is a wealth of information out there (albeit, much of it is quickly becoming outdated or conflicting). As I already mentioned, <a href="https://jabbr.net/#/rooms/EntityFramework" target="_blank" rel="external">Jabbr</a> is a great place to ask questions, as are Twitter and Stack Overflow. <a href="https://twitter.com/bricelambs" target="_blank" rel="external">Brice Lambson</a> periodically posts updates on his <a href="http://www.bricelam.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">blog</a>. I have found that the documentation for Asp.Net 5 has also been kept fairly up-to-date, which you can <a href="http://docs.asp.net/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="external">read here</a>.</p>

        <p>Uhg. That feeling when you glance at your mail client and see hundreds of messages, most of which are unread. They trail on over weeks or months and create an instant stress-booster when you sit down at your desk. It’s the feeling that someone is <em>always</em> waiting on you to do something, and you can’t quite put your finger on who, or what, or when you had that message saying that you needed to do it, but you’re always suspicious of the messages that are just out of view on-screen.</p>
<p>Stop the madness! You don’t have to live like that, and I’m telling you it’s way better to achieve “Inbox:0” on a daily basis. It’s better to spend a small, regulated portion of your day (or a few of those windows) dedicated to cleaning your inbox and to never have the weight of email on your shoulders again.</p>
<p>I was first inspired to do this through a talk at WebStock by <a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman" target="_blank" rel="external">Scott Hanselman</a>, which you can view <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ItsNotWhatYouReadItsWhatYouIgnoreVideoOfScottHanselmansPersonalProductivityTips.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>. I have to admit, I struggled for the first little while, getting on track and trying to maintain the practice. But, I’m going to do something that I couldn’t have done two years ago, and that is to share an image of my inbox.  Here it is:</p>
<p><a href="https://jcblogimages.blob.core.windows.net/img/2015/04/image4.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://jcblogimages.blob.core.windows.net/img/2015/04/image_thumb4.png" alt="image" title="image"></a></p>
<p>Beauty, eh? This isn’t here as bragging rights, I’m just trying to illustrate that this is achievable and can be a reality for you. The only really <em>hard</em> day was the first one, when I had to make the decision to nuke everything in there. From there it was just about a little discipline and establishing some good habits.</p>
<h2 id="How_to_Get_There"><a href="#How_to_Get_There" class="headerlink" title="How to Get There"></a>How to Get There</h2><p>Okay, I’m a pack rat. I didn’t <em>really</em> nuke everything in my inbox, but here’s the process I went through to whittle that baby down to a reasonable amount of mail.</p>
<p>The first step was to just admit to myself that anything older than a couple of weeks in age likely wasn’t going to be dealt with in a timely fashion. In other words…it meant that if someone had sent an email hoping to get my attention, they would have to write again. It honestly felt like I was letting people down by removing their messages. But the messages had already been reduced to clutter by virtue of my care to-date, so the damage had already been done. <strong><em>So, let it go.</em></strong> That was the biggest hurdle.</p>
<p>Next, I created a folder called Archive. I just wanted to be able to be able to find the messages should something come up (for example, needed a response from a manager or client). I moved <em>everything</em> in there that was 2 weeks old or older.  I was starting from over 10,000 messages in my inbox with 2,000+ unread.  This one step took me down to under 1,400 messages.</p>
<p>The final piece was just automating a couple of tasks. I don’t need all my build server notifications, Azure alerts or application log notices. I unsubscribed from the vendor bits I was no longer interested in (sorry, IBM and Salesforce), then deleted the messages. I created rules for these to mark the “everything is okay” messages as read and to move them to a folder. I applied these rules and got to under 250 messages.</p>
<p>20 minutes in, and I was within striking distance.</p>
<p>From that point it took me about 2 hours, but I was able to weed through the ones that weren’t really addressed to me, respond to some that needed attention and finally send a few meeting invites to folks who were requesting my time.</p>
<h2 id="How_to_Stay_There"><a href="#How_to_Stay_There" class="headerlink" title="How to Stay There"></a>How to Stay There</h2><p>The next bits aren’t nearly as hard, you just need to keep a little organized. I create top-level folders like “Projects” and “General”, then sub-folders to put client- or project-specific communication. But I don’t go overboard either - I just make small enough buckets that I can find what I’m looking for when I need it. I make sure that any new email list messages that come in get the “unsubscribe” treatment.</p>
<p>I also gave myself a few rules, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I don’t check my email as it arrives</strong>, I try to only check once an hour or so. There are exceptions, like when I know we’re in a crunch, or when I’m waiting for a message from someone in particular.</li>
<li><strong>I will scan my inbox and decide if it’s time for email</strong> before I dive in and address the messages that are waiting.  This means that, yes, sometimes it will be several hours, or even a couple of days before I clear out my inbox, but this is a priority thing. If my voice isn’t needed on a thread I try to stay out and keep focused on my work. But when I <strong><em>do</em></strong> dive in and start reading…</li>
<li><strong>I don’t leave messages in my inbox</strong>, also known as the “one touch” rule. There are really only a few things you can do with a message: respond to it, forward it to someone who can respond to it, or take an action on it.  I’ll come back to that in a second.</li>
<li><strong>I create rules to keep me sane</strong> and avoid clutter in the first place. If new alerts are created, or there are things I must be subscribed to, I create a rule to deal with those.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Taking_Action_on_Your_Email"><a href="#Taking_Action_on_Your_Email" class="headerlink" title="Taking Action on Your Email"></a>Taking Action on Your Email</h2><p>As I mentioned, I will often respond to an email right away, or perhaps forward it on to someone who can help resolve the issue at hand. But other times it requires taking action. These should be done in a timely manner and none of them take much time to do, only a minute or two:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If there is work for me to do, I put it on my calendar</strong>. I will block out a piece of time to address it, and if it’s for the benefit of someone else, I let them know that I’ve done so. This way, I’ve set an expectation I can manage and they know when they are going to get the answer or result they need, and the message is out of my inbox.</li>
<li><strong>If there is work that involves others, I schedule a meeting or work session</strong>. This can be a Skype call, a pair-programming gig or even just an online chat. Sometimes this can be an immediate action depending on those involved, other times it will be a day or two or several before we can get to it. But it’s on my calendar at that point, so it can get out of my inbox.<br>There are things that don’t belong in your inbox. That’s it. So get them out and where they belong, be it in someone else’s hands or on your calendar.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Fly_Away_2C_Stanley_2C_be_Free_21"><a href="#Fly_Away_2C_Stanley_2C_be_Free_21" class="headerlink" title="Fly Away, Stanley, be Free!"></a>Fly Away, Stanley, be Free!</h2><p><a href="https://jcblogimages.blob.core.windows.net/img/2015/04/image5.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://jcblogimages.blob.core.windows.net/img/2015/04/image_thumb5.png" alt="image" title="image"></a></p>
<p>So, there’s really no secret sauce here. If you’re still reading this, you’re likely willing to give this a try, so carve out two and a half hours in your schedule and give it a go. Make rules that work for you, and don’t sweat it if it takes you one or two attempts to make it work, or a couple of weeks to find your groove on getting things cleared out. In no time, you’ll be rocking Inbox:0 and enjoying the stress-free benefits of seeing absolutely nothing when you check your email. Just like Stanley.</p>

        <p>There is a very competent and capable app for your Microsoft Band in your App Store called Microsoft Health, which is available for iOS, Android and, of course, Windows Phone. But Microsoft Health is just one way you can expose and relay information from the myriad of sensors you’ve got on your wrist, and you’ve likely got ideas on where you’d like to take it.</p>
<p>In my <a href="http://jameschambers.com/2015/03/iot-for-humans-and-developers-getting-started-with-my-microsoft-band/">first article</a> I wrote briefly about IoT in general, and how a device like Microsoft’s Band really opens the door for .NET developers looking to take part in the wearables game. In this article, I’m going to lay out the tools and frameworks that you’ll need in order to develop for the Band.  We’ll also start up a project and install the components we need to get our app ready to talk to the device. If you’re a fairly experience developer and want to dive right in, jump down to the end for the summary and have at’er.</p>
<h2 id="Setting_up_Your_Cloud_Account"><a href="#Setting_up_Your_Cloud_Account" class="headerlink" title="Setting up Your Cloud Account"></a>Setting up Your Cloud Account</h2><p>As we collect data from the sensors, we’re going to want to feed it up to the cloud so that as we develop the backend of the app, we have access to all the data.</p>
<p>It only takes about 3 minutes and 17 seconds to give yourself a free shot at using cloud services. Seriously. So <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/click/services/Redirect2.ashx?CR_CC=200575119" target="_blank" rel="external">pop over to Azure</a> and get yourself signed up for the free trial.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/click/services/Redirect2.ashx?CR_CC=200575119" target="_blank" rel="external">Signup for Azure Here</a><br>Also, check out <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/click/services/Redirect2.ashx?CR_CC=200575136" target="_blank" rel="external">this link for information on MSDN</a> as you may also qualify for free monthly Azure benefits as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Readying_Your_Development_Environment"><a href="#Readying_Your_Development_Environment" class="headerlink" title="Readying Your Development Environment"></a>Readying Your Development Environment</h2><p>Next, we need a bit of tooling. This isn’t a complicated list and you likely have everything you need already, however, I speak to, meet with and mentor many developers who are locked into older versions of tooling, so here’s a list to follow along with so that we’re all on the same page:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/click/services/Redirect2.ashx?CR_CC=200575136" target="_blank" rel="external">MSDN</a> or <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">Community Edition</a>)</li>
<li>USB cable for your Windows Phone</li>
<li>USB charging/sync cable for your Band (included in the box)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a plethora of USB cables from a variety of sources. I have noticed that the Nokia cable that came in the box with the charger is a better quality cable and have had less problems with it than others (from cheap chargers, other phones and cameras).</p>
<h2 id="Creating_the_Project"><a href="#Creating_the_Project" class="headerlink" title="Creating the Project"></a>Creating the Project</h2><p>This part’s pretty easy, just pop open Visual Studio, select File –&gt; New Project, and then switch to the Store Apps/Windows Phone Apps category. From there, Pick the Blank App template and name your project <strong>AliveAndSafe</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://jcblogimages.blob.core.windows.net/img/2015/04/image2.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://jcblogimages.blob.core.windows.net/img/2015/04/image_thumb2.png" alt="image" title="image"></a></p>
<p>We’ll talk more about the application we’re creating next time, but if you’ve read my <a href="http://jameschambers.com/2015/03/iot-for-humans-and-developers-getting-started-with-my-microsoft-band/">previous post</a> you know where I’m going with this. <img src="https://jcblogimages.blob.core.windows.net/img/2015/04/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile.png" alt="Winking smile"></p>
<h2 id="Adding_the_Band_SDK"><a href="#Adding_the_Band_SDK" class="headerlink" title="Adding the Band SDK"></a>Adding the Band SDK</h2><p>Next up is getting the components in our project that we’ll use to interact with the Band and trap information relayed to us from the device itself.</p>
<p>Open up the Package Manager Console (View –&gt; Other Windows –&gt; Package Manager Console) and type the following command:</p>
<p><pre class="csharpcode">install-package microsoft.band -pre</pre><br>As expected, this pulls down the DLLs needed for our app and adds references to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft.Band</li>
<li>Microsoft.Band.Phone</li>
<li>Microsoft.Band.Store<br>Having a peek inside, we can see a number of interesting objects that we can create, collections to iterate over, sensors to subscribe to and states that we can inspect.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://jcblogimages.blob.core.windows.net/img/2015/04/image3.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://jcblogimages.blob.core.windows.net/img/2015/04/image_thumb3.png" alt="image" title="image"></a></p>
<p>We’re going to dive into these in more detail as we build out our app.</p>
<h2 id="Designing_for_Microsoft_Band"><a href="#Designing_for_Microsoft_Band" class="headerlink" title="Designing for Microsoft Band"></a>Designing for Microsoft Band</h2><p>An important thing to note is that the Band has a really strong and capable design language. After wearing it for only a couple of hours I felt like I had a good sense of what it was trying to do and where I needed to go, which is amazing given the number of sensors and the limited UI that the device presents!</p>
<p>As such, we should likely be good citizens here and respect the design intent that the device put forth. You can find more information on what the designers were thinking by downloading the <a href="http://developer.microsoftband.com/docs/MicrosoftBandVisualGuidelines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">Microsoft Band Visual Guidelines</a> document.</p>
<h2 id="Next_Steps"><a href="#Next_Steps" class="headerlink" title="Next Steps"></a>Next Steps</h2><p>Okay…easy lifting today, here’s what we did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepared our development environment by grabbing <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/click/services/Redirect2.ashx?CR_CC=200575136" target="_blank" rel="external">Visual Studio</a>, signing up for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/click/services/Redirect2.ashx?CR_CC=200575119" target="_blank" rel="external">Microsoft Azure</a>, and getting our cables.</li>
<li>Created a Windows Phone application using the Blank App template.</li>
<li>Added the Microsoft.Band pre-release package from Nuget to pull in our dependencies.<br>In the next article we’re going to talk a little bit more about our application that we’re building and get a tile onto the Band to represent our application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy Coding! <img src="https://jcblogimages.blob.core.windows.net/img/2015/04/wlEmoticon-smile3.png" alt="Smile"></p>

        <p>There is a great conference coming up that is open to everyone with a keyboard and a monitor. This is a <strong>free</strong> event that Microsoft and my fellow MVPs are putting on, May 14th &amp; 15th.&nbsp; Friends, presenters and fellow Microsoft MVPs from the Americas’ region will be live-streaming for two days to share their knowledge and real-world expertise during a free event, the <strong><a href="http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualconference.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">MVP Virtual Conference</a></strong>. </p>
<p>The MVP Virtual Conference will showcase 95 sessions of content for IT Pros, Developers and Consumer experts designed to help you navigate life in a mobile-first, cloud-first world. Microsoft’s Corporate Vice President of Developer Platform, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/stevengu/archive/2015/04/02/announcing-the-mvp-virtual-conference.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">Steve Guggenheimer</a>, will be on hand to deliver the opening Key Note Address. </p>
<p>Hey…if you want to play along during the conference, be sure to get yourself a copy of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/click/services/Redirect2.ashx?CR_CC=200575136" target="_blank" rel="external">Visual Studio</a> or an IDE of your choice, and sign up for your <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/click/services/Redirect2.ashx?CR_CC=200575119" target="_blank" rel="external">free Azure trial</a>.</p>
<p>I was part of the group that had the privilege of picking the sessions. I have to be honest, it wasn’t easy…there were about a billion great topics from the MVPs put forth, and right from the start it was hard to omit any single entry.</p>
<p>The are going to be 5 tracks in the conference, so there is something for everyone who works in IT, regardless of platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>IT Pro English  </li><li>Dev English  </li><li>Consumer English  </li><li>Portuguese mixed sessions  </li><li>Spanish mixed sessions </li>
</ul>
<p>There are some excellent, industry-leading names on the list. Learn from the best and brightest MVPs in the tech world today and develop some great skills.</p>
<p>Be sure to <a href="http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualconference.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">register</a> quickly (or slowly, if you don’t type too fast) to hold your spot and tell your friends &amp; colleagues. Be sure to register even if you can’t attend to get post-conference resources, links to VoD and other relevant information. There is going to be metric butt-load of information here! </p>
<p>The conference will be widely covered on social media, you can join the conversation by following <a href="https://twitter.com/MVPAward" target="_blank" rel="external">@MVPAward</a> and using the hashtag #MVPvConf.</p>
