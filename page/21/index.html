<p>Hey…this post just shot past 10,000 views and I’ve received a ton of feedback that the title was inflammatory, which is completely fair. I’ve renamed it from “Lies that Ruby on Rails People Tell You” to the above, as I realize I was painting with the same wide strokes I am complaining about in this post. Thanks to all who were calling me on my BS title.&nbsp; Cheers, -JC </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the course of the last several years I’ve had the pleasure of working with developers from many different backgrounds.&nbsp; It is true that there is incredible talent in every discipline. It is also true that you can build out great solutions on any of today’s modern frameworks.</p>
<p>I got my legs programming when it was cool to hate Microsoft (the first time around).&nbsp; I built CGIs that ran on Linux servers, attended “distro install competitions”, ran my home internet off of the Linux Router on a Floppy project and through it all maintained that the blue mothership from Redmond was evil.</p>
<p>Then I grew up.</p>
<p>The reality of a multi-platform solution hit me very early in my career. It was great to be part of a production environment where many different engineers took on projects of different capacities requiring multiple skillsets and a ton of teamwork. I had learned that the “right way” to do something <em>was</em> through teamwork, cooperation and ingenuity, and that a particular breed of technology or the language you chose played a much smaller role in a successful project.</p>
<p>For over a decade now I have been programming primarily on the MS stack, and in the last three years have spent a lot of time working with the MVC Framework. I enjoy the workflow, the toolset, the community and especially the opportunities I’ve been granted that allow me to share my experience and mentor others.</p>
<p>Today, it is the attitude I once held – that the way to do all things is the way I do it with the technology I prefer – it’s that attitude that frustrates me more than anything. It really is true that the things you like least in others are the things you like least about yourself.</p>
<h2 id="Okay_2C_So_What_Am_I_Trying_to_Do_Here_3F"><a href="#Okay_2C_So_What_Am_I_Trying_to_Do_Here_3F" class="headerlink" title="Okay, So What Am I Trying to Do Here?"></a>Okay, So What Am I Trying to Do Here?</h2><p>Let’s start with what I’m <em>not</em> doing. I am <em>not</em> trying to say that the MVC Framework is better than Ruby on Rails.&nbsp; That may be my opinion, but that’s because it’s <em>best for me.</em> Please appreciate the difference.</p>
<p>What I <em>am</em> trying to do is to show that there is much less of a gap than might be suggested. The MVC Framework is mature, stable, performant, and worth exploring. It is also very likely worth switching to if you are on older tech.</p>
<p>What I am <em>also</em> trying to do is to grow the chorus of folks who are willing to try new things out. This is the one I hope I win at, because this is how things are going to get better. I often use the analogy of the iPhone, Android and Windows Phone. We have three <em>great</em> options for smart phones because there are three vendors taking a serious whack at the cat.</p>
<h2 id="Oh_Ruby_2C_Don_u2019t_Take_Your_Love_to_Town"><a href="#Oh_Ruby_2C_Don_u2019t_Take_Your_Love_to_Town" class="headerlink" title="Oh Ruby, Don’t Take Your Love to Town"></a>Oh Ruby, Don’t Take Your Love to Town</h2><p>While I’ve had the privilege of working with some of the brightest minds along the way, I’ve also been part of teams where being at odds over which tech to use ends in turmoil on the project. Throughout my career the arguments have varied and blurred in focus between operating systems, languages, platforms, patterns, frameworks or even companies.&nbsp; Windows vs. Linux, c++ vs. Java, Mac vs. PC, iPhone vs. Android, AWS versus Azure, .Net vs. [insert any framework here].&nbsp; Some battles seem to be more intense than others, but in the last year I discovered one that actually blindsided me, I was completely unaware it was brewing. </p>
<p>And it comes from Ruby on Rails developers.</p>
<h1 id="Judging_Books"><a href="#Judging_Books" class="headerlink" title="Judging Books"></a>Judging Books</h1><p>I want to be fair here – there’s more than one camp in the Rails world and I’ve met some insanely intelligent, productive, passionate developers who could do pretty much anything for mobile and web in RoR.&nbsp; I’ve worked alongside some that have a background using .Net.&nbsp; But there’s a slice of the Railers that has either never used the MVC Framework or used it in an early incarnation and have since not only condemned the thing, but also the developers that do good things – intelligently, productively and passionately – working inside Visual Studio.</p>
<p>More recently, I’ve been surprised by the venomous bile that has built up in some of these folks’ throats over the last year, to a point where they are spreading inaccurate, misleading and even entirely made up points to counter what is offered in the .NET camp for MVC development.&nbsp; So I want to set the wheels in motion to correct some of these myths.</p>
<h2 id="Myth_1_3A_It_u2019s_Easier_to_Bootstrap_a_Project_In_Rails"><a href="#Myth_1_3A_It_u2019s_Easier_to_Bootstrap_a_Project_In_Rails" class="headerlink" title="Myth 1: It’s Easier to Bootstrap a Project In Rails"></a>Myth 1: It’s Easier to Bootstrap a Project In Rails</h2><p>It’s quite easy in Rails to get started. If you are comfortable with the command line you can create a new project by invoking a couple of commands. You can use template sites or boiler-plate generators that allow you to select the most common elements and assemble a project to get started.&nbsp; There are also UI-based tools that facilitate a basic template of a project in Rails to get you kickstarted.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t make it easier.&nbsp; Just different.</p>
<p>As an MVC Framework developer, I also get my choice of options. To start with, I can just say “File-&gt;New-&gt;Project”. I can use default project templates that are included in Visual Studio, download starter projects from the web, or, if I prefer, start with a completely empty solution and use Nuget to cherry-pick functionality that other developers have made available. </p>
<h2 id="Myth_2_3A_It_u2019s_Easier_to_Manage_Packages_Rails"><a href="#Myth_2_3A_It_u2019s_Easier_to_Manage_Packages_Rails" class="headerlink" title="Myth 2: It’s Easier to Manage Packages Rails"></a>Myth 2: It’s Easier to Manage Packages Rails</h2><p>This one was true, especially a couple of years ago. But Nuget – the open source package manager for Visual Studio – has come a long way and as of this writing there are very few things that it lacks. You can manage packages at the solution or project level. You can leave your binaries out of source control and leverage automatic package restore. You can cache projects at the machine or solution level. You can (very easily!) build out your own Nuget server, or use a third party solution like MyGet to host widely available private package feeds or an internal corporate feed.&nbsp; Semantic versioning, dependencies, package upgrades and more are all implemented.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Furthermore, the Package Manager Console is built on top of PowerShell and can be extended by Nuget Packages, meaning other developers can push out new functionality to your IDE along with functionality for your project by adding new commands to the Console.&nbsp; It also has access to (almost) the entire extensibility points that Visual Studio offers, so it can modify your configuration, add files, create references, or insert code and more to affect your project.</p>
<p>And, especially for .Net developers, there are additional benefits.&nbsp; Nuget is not limited exclusively to MVC projects; rather, you can use it for console apps, web service projects, Windows 8 or Windows Phone projects or whatever you like, so it’s opened the door to even more sharing and open source community to more devs around the world.</p>
<h2 id="Myth_3_3A_It_u2019s_Better_to_Develop_with_RoR_Because_it_u2019s_Open_Source"><a href="#Myth_3_3A_It_u2019s_Better_to_Develop_with_RoR_Because_it_u2019s_Open_Source" class="headerlink" title="Myth 3: It’s Better to Develop with RoR Because it’s Open Source"></a>Myth 3: It’s Better to Develop with RoR Because it’s Open Source</h2><p>If your personal opinion or corporate agenda is that it’s “better” to develop on OSS solutions, then good on you. For the record, the MVC Framework is completely open source. So is the <em>entire</em> Asp.Net stack. And the script libraries that are included in the project templates.&nbsp; Oh, and Nuget, too.&nbsp; This is not a differentiator for Rails.</p>
<h2 id="Myth_4_3A_I_Get_More_Options_for_View_Engines/I_u2019m_not_Limited_by_Microsoft_View_Engines"><a href="#Myth_4_3A_I_Get_More_Options_for_View_Engines/I_u2019m_not_Limited_by_Microsoft_View_Engines" class="headerlink" title="Myth 4: I Get More Options for View Engines/I’m not Limited by Microsoft View Engines"></a>Myth 4: I Get More Options for View Engines/I’m not Limited by Microsoft View Engines</h2><p>First of all…what limitations?&nbsp; The Razor view engine – the default for MVC – is likely one of the best view engines around right now. It did not have to support years of history when it was crafted, but it got to learn from it. It is intelligent <em>as all get out</em> and understands inline switching between code and markup. It is darn fast. It is terse (though not as much as Haml, for example) and versatile. </p>
<p>There are other view engines available to the MVC Framework such as Spark, NVelocity, Brail, or others or you can write your own.</p>
<p>Yes, in RoR there are many view engines. But like the MVC Framework there is a default, a whole bunch of less relevant engines and niche ones that exist to satisfy niche requirements.&nbsp; Several people have demonstrated why they <em>prefer</em> certain ones over others, but no one has shown me why their view engine of choice is <em>better.</em></p>
<h2 id="Myth_5_3A_Ruby_on_Rails_has_Been_Around_Longer_and_is_More_Mature"><a href="#Myth_5_3A_Ruby_on_Rails_has_Been_Around_Longer_and_is_More_Mature" class="headerlink" title="Myth 5: Ruby on Rails has Been Around Longer and is More Mature"></a>Myth 5: Ruby on Rails has Been Around Longer and is More Mature</h2><p>This is an irrelevant, misleading comment that is usually followed by statements like “there are more answers to questions on Stack Overflow” or “there is a better community” or the like.</p>
<p>Let’s address the first point: Ruby on rails has indeed been around longer than the MVC Framework, but this is a slight of hand.&nbsp; The MVC Framework is built on top of the .NET Framework and the toolset for MVC is an extension of Visual Studio.&nbsp; Maturity isn’t dictated by age, and what is really important is how comfortable you are with your tools.</p>
<p>I know, right away, that comments will fly like “Visual Studio is a memory pig and crashes all the time” or “Sure, I like VS, it’s the best wrapper for ReSharper that’s out there”.&nbsp; Fine, if you prefer a different environment that is your choice, but it doesn’t mean you can dismiss VS for what it is: the software development tool used by more professionals than other other IDE on the planet (I can’t speak for the moon).&nbsp; I use it every day with very little friction and the productivity wins are quite large. </p>
<p>On the second point: Stack Overflow may have more questions about Ruby. But let’s not forget that more people asking questions might not be a “good” thing! Let’s pause and think <em>why</em> people might be asking questions for a moment. Are they relevant for recent releases? What are the quality of the answers?&nbsp; Or the questions?&nbsp; And if your party line is that more questions are better, then head over to the Microsoft forums where there will be questions on MVC, ASP.NET, c#, Visual Studio, or the .Net Framework itself.&nbsp; You’re likely to find just as many bad questions, answers, arguments and features in any language, if you look hard enough.</p>
<h2 id="Myth_6_3A_Ruby_Tooling_Provides_Better_Database_Practices"><a href="#Myth_6_3A_Ruby_Tooling_Provides_Better_Database_Practices" class="headerlink" title="Myth 6: Ruby Tooling Provides Better Database Practices"></a>Myth 6: Ruby Tooling Provides Better Database Practices</h2><p>I will be quite frank: until EF Code First had migrations, it was a great little hack to use in presentations and show how fast a developer I could be. Even in the earlier versions of EFCF migrations there were struggles to understand targeting, versions, naming, which connection strings were being used, etc.</p>
<p>But today’s database tooling is much better, and the MVC Framework aligns quite well with corporate environments and software professionals around the world.&nbsp; Everything you need for automatic DB generation is built into the default MVC project templates with no additional requirements or dependencies to add.</p>
<p>But if you don’t want to use Entity Framework, how do you access the DB in the MVC world? However you want to. That’s abstracted away so that you can have SQL, SQL Express, My SQL, Oracle, or CSVs files retrieved via JSON served from a Commodore 64.&nbsp; It doesn’t matter what you choose.&nbsp; You can pick whatever ORM you like.</p>
<p>And if you do choose EF Code First, then I’m happy to say that migrations have finally arrived. You can use choose your strategy for database creation, seeding or migrating up and down, or use the default (and quite capable) behaviour. You can enable settings that allow for very rapid prototyping or strict it up to prevent nilly-willy changes.&nbsp; Your “plain old CLR objects” or POCOs are used to infer your naming, relationships, indexes and defaults, but you can override this behaviour as well.&nbsp; Objects and properties are strongly typed, navigation across entities is discoverable as you code and much of what is there will be familiar to experienced developers.</p>
<p>Besides, what do you do in a RoR application if you have to use legacy data?&nbsp; Or if corporate requirements dictate the inclusion of Data Architects on your project? You have to slog code, that’s what.</p>
<p>Again, this is an area that has virtually been eliminated as a talking point when it comes to comparing the frameworks.</p>

You may be more familiar with where your bits need to be flipped, but this is just an issue of groove.&nbsp; Once you know where things are – in either MVC or Ruby on Rails – you build a comfort level with your tools, classes, scripts, models, packages, etc. and you get to work.&nbsp; You may prefer your toolset over another but let me assure you that I don’t stumble around in my projects trying to find the parts I’m going after.</p>
<p>I know exactly where my models go.&nbsp; And my views.&nbsp; And helpers.&nbsp; And filters.&nbsp; If you come from the Ruby world and you don’t know where these things go, I can also assure you that the directory structure is no less intimidating in RoR projects when you aren’t familiar with the layout, patterns or best practices.&nbsp; This is <em>exactly</em> why we learn our tools, languages and environments: so that we can be productive.</p>
<p>I have had live conversations with the actual humans (yes, they are humans!) who have built out Razor, the MVC Framework, Nuget and who have otherwise been big contributors to the ASP.NET landscape.&nbsp; They are just as concerned about building out a great development experience as anyone else out there building tools.</p>
<h2 id="Myth_8_3A_It_u2019s_Easier_to_Target_Any_Environment_I_Want"><a href="#Myth_8_3A_It_u2019s_Easier_to_Target_Any_Environment_I_Want" class="headerlink" title="Myth 8: It’s Easier to Target Any Environment I Want"></a>Myth 8: It’s Easier to Target Any Environment I Want</h2><p>One of the great things about Ruby on Rails is the ability to just create a copy of environment you’re working with – say your test environment – rename it and then simply alter the configuration elements you need changed for the new one.</p>
<p>One of the great things about solutions in Visual Studio is the ability to just create a copy of environment you’re working with – say your test environment – rename it and then simply alter the configuration elements you need changed for the new one.</p>
<p>See what I did there?</p>

Seriously.&nbsp; There are _great _things in the RoR world, and there are <em>great</em> things in the .Net world.&nbsp; They argument that “well, they just copied x from y” when you are talking about any framework is pointless.&nbsp; I can’t see how any professional would argue otherwise.</p>
<p>There are many different shapes of hammers; they all pound nails.</p>
<p>When we accept that – and learn from each other, rather than beating each other up – then we can challenge and inspire each other and push our craft much further.&nbsp; You can’t say you’re a better developer than me because you’ve memorized your syntax, and I can’t say I’m the better dev because I’m faster with IntelliSense.&nbsp; We’re different.</p>
<p>And, man, that’s just plain.Okay().</p>
<h1 id="Steps_v-Next"><a href="#Steps_v-Next" class="headerlink" title="Steps v.Next"></a>Steps v.Next</h1><p>If you are a Ruby on Rails developer, I highly encourage you to grab the free tooling and <a href="http://asp.net/mvc" target="_blank" rel="external">try on some Mvc</a>.</p>

        <p>I am continuing my series on using Twitter’s Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript library with the Asp.Net Mvc 4 Framework. Here’s the <a href="http://oldblog.jameschambers.com/blog/bootstrap-asp.net-mvc-quickhits-installing-bootstrap" target="_blank" rel="external">rest of the series</a>, and today’s instalment of the video is here:</p>
<iframe height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/uA7Z8WfD3bU" frameborder="0" width="560" allowfullscreen></iframe> 

<p>User “arun” wrote in on <a href="http://oldblog.jameschambers.com/blog/bootstrapping-mvc---the-completed-template" target="_blank" rel="external">my previous post</a>, asking about a problem with the rendering of the navbar when the responsive design elements kicked in. I fired up the project to see what was amiss.&nbsp; What I found when I made the browser more narrow was this:</p>
<p><a href="http://oldblog.jameschambers.com/Media/Default/Windows-Live-Writer/Bootstrap--Mvc---Fixing-the-Navbar_BBD9/image_6.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://oldblog.jameschambers.com/Media/Default/Windows-Live-Writer/Bootstrap--Mvc---Fixing-the-Navbar_BBD9/image_thumb_2.png" alt="image" title="image"></a></p>
<p>What’s with that white space?&nbsp; Here’s what we _really _want:</p>
<p><a href="http://oldblog.jameschambers.com/Media/Default/Windows-Live-Writer/Bootstrap--Mvc---Fixing-the-Navbar_BBD9/image_8.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://oldblog.jameschambers.com/Media/Default/Windows-Live-Writer/Bootstrap--Mvc---Fixing-the-Navbar_BBD9/image_thumb_3.png" alt="image" title="image"></a></p>
<p>Yay! No whitespace! How did we make it happen? Turns out it’s quite easy, just make your layout header look like this:</p>
<p><pre class="csharpcode">    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">style</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span><br>        body { padding-top: 60px; /<em> 60px to make the container go all the way to the bottom of the topbar </em>/ }<br>        .aligntobottom { bottom:0; position:absolute; }<br>    <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">style</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre></p>
<pre><code>@Scripts.Render(&quot;~/bundles/modernizr&quot;)
@Styles.Render(&quot;~/Content/Bootstrap&quot;)&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre><style type="text/css">.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre
{
    font-size: small;
    color: black;
    font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;
    background-color: #ffffff;
    /*white-space: pre;*/
}
.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }
.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }
.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }
.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }
.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }
.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }
.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }
.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }
.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }
.csharpcode .alt 
{
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    width: 100%;
    margin: 0em;
}
.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }
</style>

<p>Notice that we’re moving the Bootstrap library <em>below</em> the body padding style so that we can get around a CSS conflict.</p>

        <p>I’ve been presenting for over a year now and I can honestly say that one of my favourite sessions to have taken part in so far was this past week at the Prairie IT &amp; Developer Conference in Regina.&nbsp; <a href="https://twitter.com/i/#!/CanadianJames/media/slideshow?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitpic.com%2Fb05rhn" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://oldblog.jameschambers.com/Media/Default/Windows-Live-Writer/Almost-8-Web-Services-in-75-Minutes---Wi_495B/image_3.png" alt="image" title="image"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/i/#!/CanadianJames/media/slideshow?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitpic.com%2Fb05rhn" target="_blank" rel="external">Chad McCallum</a>, a regular contributor to the tech scene in Regina, was presenting his web services session, and I was to present a talk on Web API. We realized before the conference that there was going to be a lot of conceptual overlap, so we made the call to merge the sessions and deliver some awesome. <img src="http://oldblog.jameschambers.com/Media/Default/Windows-Live-Writer/Almost-8-Web-Services-in-75-Minutes---Wi_495B/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png" alt="Smile"></p>
<h1 id="The_Setup"><a href="#The_Setup" class="headerlink" title="The Setup"></a>The Setup</h1><p>So here’s how we did it: Chad’s talk normally revolves around him demonstrating how easy it is to build out web services in the .NET world, not only with Microsoft tech, but with libraries available through the open source community as well. Other times he’s presented, Chad demonstrated a console app where he consumed whichever service he was building so that the audience could see the service in action.</p>
<p>For our tandem presentation, we decided on a twist: while he was writing the service, I would use a copy of the pre-built service and build a client or a service call through some kind of tooling.&nbsp; The catch? The audience got to pick what I would be using.&nbsp; As he was about to start building his service, the audience picked from a list of possible clients that I would build, and I had anywhere from 4-10 minutes to consume the service.</p>
<p>Here’s the client list the audience got to choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li>WinForms  </li><li>Asp.Net MVC  </li><li>Console App  </li><li>Windows Phone App  </li><li>Browser Request  </li><li>Fiddler Request </li>
</ul>
<p>And the services Chad was building were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asp.Net ASMX Web Service  </li><li>Asp.Net MVC 3 (JSON result)  </li><li><a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc" target="_blank" rel="external">Asp.Net MVC 4 Web Api</a>  </li><li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb332338.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">WCF</a>  </li><li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd315413.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">WCF REST</a>  </li><li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb412167.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">WCF AJAX</a>  </li><li><a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy" target="_blank" rel="external">Nancy</a>  </li><li><a href="http://www.servicestack.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">ServiceStack</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>I’m intentionally not linking to documentation on the first two because if you are starting a new project, there are very few reasons why you would start there. If you’re already building in those spaces, you’ll know how to get the resources.</p>
<p>The fun part was that with almost 50 permutations there was no way we were going to build these out ahead of time, so this was all live-in-front-of-the-audience coding.&nbsp; Chad built the services, I built the clients, all in front of almost 50 sharp and scrutinizing devs. It was awesome.</p>
<h1 id="The_Result"><a href="#The_Result" class="headerlink" title="The Result"></a>The Result</h1><p>For the most part, everything turned out great!&nbsp; We had a couple of glitches as I’ll describe below, and we geeked out a little too much in some areas so we only got through 7 of the services, just 1 short of our goal.&nbsp; Here’s what didn’t go <em>quite</em> as expected:</p>
<ul>
<li>The pre-built services used a simple ECHO method, but during the presentation Chad decided to go all rogue on me and use a .ToUpper in his service method.&nbsp; Even though I finished the client in time – and it worked – the audience picked up real quickly that the text returned and displayed on my client was not converted to upper-case. There was no slight of hand here, just a crossed wire. Full credit to Chad for going further on demonstrating a more interesting method, and even more to the gentleman who picked up on it!  </li><li>When I built the Windows Phone app and tested quickly before showing the result, I had tested with the word “Regina”, and it worked a treat. But when I demo’d the client for the audience, I punched in “Hello, Regina…”. Unfortunately, I didn’t URL-encode the request, so the punctuation threw off the request/service/response love and it errored out on me. <img src="http://oldblog.jameschambers.com/Media/Default/Windows-Live-Writer/Almost-8-Web-Services-in-75-Minutes---Wi_495B/wlEmoticon-sadsmile_2.png" alt="Sad smile">&nbsp; I quickly found the mistake and reran the app to show it was working, but it’s worth pointing out that even in simple scenarios you’ll need to test with more than a simple “Hello” string. </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="What_u2019s_Next_3F"><a href="#What_u2019s_Next_3F" class="headerlink" title="What’s Next?"></a>What’s Next?</h1><p>Well, Chad and I really didn’t dive too deep into the daily practical uses of these, or what scenarios the project types could be used in, but we did give the group a few things to chew on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you building something for internal use, or public use?  </li><li>Do you intend to open up your API?  </li><li>Do you plan on making mobile apps?  </li><li>What are your security considerations, and what do users authenticate against?  </li><li>What have you worked with in the past, and what do you plan on working with down the road? </li>
</ul>
<p>Those are five simple questions that will help determine the approach to take for your project. Chad and I are both of the mind that JSON/REST services are probably what you are going to be looking for, but if you can disqualify this approach we presented a myriad of options and alternatives.</p>
<h1 id="The_Most_Important_Thing"><a href="#The_Most_Important_Thing" class="headerlink" title="The Most Important Thing"></a>The Most Important Thing</h1><p>What we really wanted to show is that someone comfortable with programming on the .NET stack can easily try these things out. If you count both our times, Chad building the service and me building the client, we took from 8 to 20 minutes to build <em>BOTH</em> sides of the equation. In less than half an hour you could be exploring any one of these service approaches with pretty much any kind of client.&nbsp; So, go File –&gt; New Project yourself some service love!</p>

It was great to see so many people out with such diverse backgrounds. We had people who develop on Android, Windows Phone, iOS and lots of .Net folks who are interested in building apps for Windows 8.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I had a blast presenting…and getting an app up and running with a cloud-backend for the services side of things with a fully functional Windows 8 client is pretty great.&nbsp; But I ran into one major snafu when I tried to get Push Notifications running and, subsequently, Windows Account authentication.</p>
<h2 id="What_Went_Wrong"><a href="#What_Went_Wrong" class="headerlink" title="What Went Wrong"></a>What Went Wrong</h2><p><a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-ca/develop/mobile/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://jameschambers.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image2.png" alt="image" title="image"></a>Preparing for the conference I had built out the demo app several times as I dove into WAMS and examined what was going on at each level.&nbsp; Each time I would reset the environments by deleting the application and database and removing it from Live Connect Developer Center.&nbsp; Things were fairly clean.</p>
<p>When I started the presentation things were going fine until I realized that I had forgot to reset after my last run through the night before.&nbsp; When I logged into the management portal, I saw the app was still there, so I deleted the app (and database) and carried on with my demo.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Unfortunately</strong>, when I got to enabling push notifications, the Live Connect Developer Center let me go about creating an app with the same name, and it did so without warnings or errors. Though I didn’t have time to solve it during the session (what a great group of attendees though, giving me some space to explore!), what I nailed down was this:&nbsp; when I created a new app – with the same name – I think very simply that I ended up confusing Live Connect as to which app was which.</p>
<p>Further to that, authentication wouldn’t work either. Even though I discovered and deleted the second (well, I guess first) rogue app in Live Connect and verified that my app secret and package ID was correct, I still wasn’t able to authenticate. In the log files for the app in the WAMS portal, I was simple getting a message similar to “invalid client” without further explanation.</p>
<p>I was able to finish out the presentation and give them a sense of how things would have worked, and from the feedback in talking with some devs afterwards, it seems they were fairly forgiving <img src="http://jameschambers.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile"></p>
<h2 id="And_So_3F"><a href="#And_So_3F" class="headerlink" title="And So?"></a>And So?</h2><p><strong>Do not create a second app in Live Connect Developer Center with the same name as an existing app</strong>.&nbsp; This is bad and will break your stride.</p>
<p>I got back to my hotel room, deleted the leftover pieces from the demonstration and started again from scratch – this time giving a unique name to my app – and everything worked from end-to-end without hassle or hesitation – push notifications, Windows Account authentication and the whole like.&nbsp; <strong>It took me 8 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>There really should be appropriate error messages here so that you can make sense of what’s going on. Or, better yet, the Live Connect Developer Center should slap your wrist and tell you that there is already an app on your account with the same name.</p>
<p>But this one is easy to avoid. Just don’t duplicate your app names!</p>
<p>If you want to see for yourself how easy it is to get started, head over to the <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-ca/develop/mobile/" target="_blank" rel="external">WAMS site</a> and get started!</p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone who came out and please remember to fill in those evaluations!</p>

        <p><img src="http://hackdays.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HackDays.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Yesterday I had the pleasure of participating in HackRegina, an event organized by <a href="https://twitter.com/ChadEmm" target="_blank" rel="external">Chad McCallum</a> and supported by <a href="http://hackdays.ca" target="_blank" rel="external">HackDays.ca</a> with a ton of sponsors.&nbsp; There were about 40 people who came out to build apps and hack together solutions to solve the world’s problems. </p>
<p>Coming with neither a solid idea, nor a team, I was lucky enough to partner up with <a href="https://twitter.com/jlindenbaum" target="_blank" rel="external">Johannes Lindenbaum</a>. I think we actually ended up going with the first idea that we threw out there and just pushed through on a “this train must stay on the rails or we will not finish our project” track.&nbsp; </p>
<p>And the end of the day, Johannes and I put together a complete geo-location based game called <strong>DiscovR</strong>, focused on the City of Regina, and ended up winning the prize for “Best Windows Phone”. We took home some loot to boot.&nbsp; If you didn’t read that last sentence too carefully, I’m fully geeking out over the fact that we built a whole game in about 6.5 hours.</p>
<h2 id="The_Idea"><a href="#The_Idea" class="headerlink" title="The Idea"></a>The Idea</h2><p>Here is the basic idea: players compete for points, awarded for being the first to explore part of Regina. Each day, a new “goal” is posted to the game’s backend, and the race is on to check in at the new location and capture the most points.&nbsp; After you’ve checked in, you get a chance to see all the local restaurants and pubs (based on your location).&nbsp; Each check in reduces the points left for the next person who checks in, so the fastest onsite gets to climb the leaderboard the fastest.</p>
<p>All of this in the name of exploring the City of Regina.</p>
<h2 id="The_Build"><a href="#The_Build" class="headerlink" title="The Build"></a>The Build</h2><p><a href="http://oldblog.jameschambers.com/Media/Default/Windows-Live-Writer/ee3ae11418f7_A726/SplashScreenImage_2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://oldblog.jameschambers.com/Media/Default/Windows-Live-Writer/ee3ae11418f7_A726/SplashScreenImage_thumb.jpg" alt="SplashScreenImage" title="SplashScreenImage"></a>In a nutshell, here’s all the APIs, SDKs, libraries and tools that we used to get the game running:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-ca/" target="_blank" rel="external">Windows Azure Mobile Services</a><pre><code>*   This is how we got up and running quickly with our backend. We were saving game information within 30 minutes of starting our project.&amp;nbsp; All our REST end points were automatically generated for us and WAMS takes care of all the CRUD operations for us. &lt;li&gt;[Eclipse IDE](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/moreinfo/java.php)
*   The best native app development environment for building Android apps. &lt;li&gt;[Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
*   Used to build the game client (used to play the game). Provides development libraries, an emulator and deployment tools for Android devices. &lt;li&gt;[Visual Studio 2010](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/whats-new)
*   Building apps for .Net, Windows or Windows Phone, this is just what you use. &lt;li&gt;[Windows Phone SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=27570)
*   Helped us build the game manager, used to set new goals for the game players. Provides development libraries, an emulator and deployment tools for Windows Phone. &lt;li&gt;[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
*   I wrote the game rules on the cloud, hosted on Azure. There&apos;s a layer to Azure Mobile Services that lets you intercept the CRUD operations to incorporate security, push notifications, dynamic model composition and more. All your server side scripts get to leverage Node. &lt;li&gt;[SQL Azure](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-ca/)
*   This is the data store that backs Windows Azure Mobile Services. For the most part, we didn&apos;t even need to remember it was there, but when it came to resetting the database before our presentation, we were able to connect with SQL Management Studio and just execute the appropriate queries to clean things up. &lt;li&gt;[City of Regina Open Data API](http://openregina.cloudapp.net/)
*   A municipal government that gets it – or is at least starting to.&amp;nbsp; Great on them for making a ton of data available for free, public consumption. &lt;li&gt;[Yellow API](http://www.yellowapi.com/)
*   This is where we got our data for exploring the neighbourhood after you&apos;ve checked in for your points. &lt;li&gt;[Fiddler2](http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/)
*   A comprehensive tool that lets you compose and deconstruct HTTP messages.&amp;nbsp; We used this – paired with dynamic schema in WAMS – to build out our first JSON messages and layout our data model. &lt;li&gt;[Silverlight Toolkit for Windows Phone](http://silverlight.codeplex.com/)
*   A great little suite of components that help to make great looking apps for Windows Phone. 
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whew. Looking at that list, it’s hard to believe we built the game in less than a day. But it sure validates my statement about having no room for things going wrong!</p>
<h2 id="What_Went_Wrong"><a href="#What_Went_Wrong" class="headerlink" title="What Went Wrong"></a>What Went Wrong</h2><p><a href="http://openregina.cloudapp.net/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://oldblog.jameschambers.com/Media/Default/Windows-Live-Writer/ee3ae11418f7_A726/hubtiles_cc6f0e54-8f88-429c-81a2-26f38c5bad6e.png" alt="hubtiles" title="hubtiles"></a>We made smart choices early and spent some time thinking about the path of least resistance, and for the most part this served us well.&nbsp; There were a few hiccups along the way.</p>
<ul>
<li>Android not playing nicely with HTTPS  </li><li>Windows Phone not reporting back meaningful error messages related to networking  </li><li>City of Regina “Point of Interest API” is a great start, but it provides no rich content about <em>why</em> the point is interesting  </li><li>Yellow Pages API gives you data like it’s 1999.&nbsp; Seriously. Like, they wrote some XML in 1999 and then just wrapped curly braces around it and called it JSON.  </li><li>OAuth. I don’t need to say any more than that.  </li><li>OData web services wrap results in a “d” property…so you if want to deserialize the data you have to create an object representing the response, then have a property called “d” which is an array of the actual model. Blog post with samples are coming. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was one other challenge.&nbsp; Windows Azure Mobile Services provides this great wrapper for CRUD operations that allows you to use JavaScript (Node.js) and manipulate requests and responses. It’s a great model, but it’s not mature and the documentation is not at the level it needs to be at yet.&nbsp; This wasn’t a problem with WAMS or Node, just a challenge in early adoption.&nbsp; A big shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/TommyLee" target="_blank" rel="external">Tommy Lee</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jrozenblit" target="_blank" rel="external">Jonathan Rozenblit</a> of Microsoft for helping throughout the day to get me info, docs and articles.</p>
<h2 id="The_Android_Client"><a href="#The_Android_Client" class="headerlink" title="The Android Client"></a>The Android Client</h2><p>The screenshots above are from the WP7 app that we considered to be the “game master”. It was capable of reading information from the Regina API and then – through authenticated REST calls to Windows Azure Mobile Services – set new goals for the players.</p>
<p>As for the Android shots below, I have no claim to these…the Android client was put together by Johannes and he was kind enough to send along the screenies. I’m certain that if there was an award for “best Android app” we would have won that as well.&nbsp; Here they are! From left to right, you have the check in point where you reach the goal, the confirmation of your points, the tie in of activities to “check out” and finally the leaderboard.</p>

<p>A few more days and I should be able to catch up to Johannes!</p>
<h2 id="World_Peace_and_Other_Take-Aways"><a href="#World_Peace_and_Other_Take-Aways" class="headerlink" title="World Peace and Other Take-Aways"></a>World Peace and Other Take-Aways</h2><p>Folks, a German boy and a Ukrainian boy worked side by side to build an Android game (with a Windows Phone admin console) running on Windows Azure.&nbsp; There is Shalom in Regina.</p>
<p>I was surprised by the number of APIs that are out there, freely available. I was equally jarred by the diversity of apps that teams concocted at the event given that we were mostly working from the same APIs.&nbsp; And this is really why these events shine; the exposure to other people’s creative process is quite valuable.</p>
<p>This was a great experience that I am going to do again. If you haven’t done a hack event before – and chances are you haven’t – I really recommend breaking down some barriers (or excuses) and just go out and do it. You get to work with interesting people and if you want to you get to explore some new tech at the same time.</p>
